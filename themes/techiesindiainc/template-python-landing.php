						<h4 class="color-yellow Text-Uppercase">Python does not support Ecommerce</h4>
						<p class="color-white">One common misconception that people hold about Python is actually nothing more than a myth. Python is an outstanding platform which lends a sturdy and secure base for all your business applications.  Python has been successfully used to build ERP and e-Commerce systems. Odoo and
							Tryton and some of the supporting systems on Python that serve as a complete enterprise management suite.</p>

						<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/images/scale-icon.png" alt=""  />
						<h4 class="color-blue-light Text-Uppercase">Python does not scale</h4>
						<p class="color-white">Bursting one of the biggest myths encompassing Python, that it does not scale. Fact is, it lends itself easily to both horizontal as well as vertical scalability. Python is built keeping in mind profiling and optimisation and hence you do not waste time in fixing failures due to segmentation. Moreover companies like Dropbox, Youtube, Instagram and Quora
							use Python as their core technology which may clarify any more doubts on Python’s ability to scale.</p>

						<h4 class="color-beige Text-Uppercase">Python is too slow</h4>
						<p class="color-white">Another common myth which keeps you away from using this amazing platform is regarding its speed. Reality is that, it is considerably faster than JavaScript and Ruby but might be a bit slower than C and C++. Even this has been taken care of by PyPy’s JIT compilation for performing faster than C. Python is a dynamic language
							which allows developers to concentrate on high-level implementations thereby optimising their time.</p>

						<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/images/project-icon.png" alt="" />
						<h4 class="color-gree-light Text-Uppercase">Python is not suitable for large projects</h4>
						<p class="color-white">On the contrary; Python has been successfully implemented and used in large projects like YouTube, Dropbox, JP Morgan and even Bank of America. Using millions of lines of coding in Python in a single project, it has exceptional characteristics of packaging and modularity. With its strong and sturdy
							conventions and code review capabilities, Python is amazing to manage big teams and projects.</p>
